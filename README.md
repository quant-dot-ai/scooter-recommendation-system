# Recommendation System
![Cream and Yellow Illustrated Scooter Sale Twitter Post](https://github.com/quant-dot-ai/scooter-recommendation-system/assets/146693417/d42abe45-fd1b-4eee-a69d-ccf53cac55a2)

### Introduction
Electric scooters are a great way to get around. They are prevent you from being late to class, save the environment and quite fun. But one quick search online will flood you with options. This makes it  really difficult to choose the right one for your specific needs. Battery capacity, motor rpm and weight listed on shopping websites do not mean a lot to the average consumer (unless you are an electric scooter aficionado). We aim to simplify this choice by going through many (and I mean MANY) user and critic reviews, figure out the common features and the sentiment around scooters to recommend the perfect one for you!

### Data Used
Our custom built ![Feature dataset]() and ![Reviews Dataset]()  were created by scraping thousands of reviews from Amazon and youtube video comments.
